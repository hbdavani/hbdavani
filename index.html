						I still remember how we both ended up wearing jeans and top on the first day of college!
						#Twinning
						Its crazy to think we've known each other for just 3 years coz it feels like more. To sitting
						together in the front benches, knowing nothing in class, our endless rant and gossip sessions,
						all those lunch breaks at tasty bites where you had your aloo paratha (bleh 🙄) and my rajma
						rice! To stalking TJ and talking about useless boys 🙈 from our cute lunch dates to my first
						night out with yall and ofc the countless times ive been to your room to just chill. Everything
						brings back such fond memories that i absolutely cherish and will hold close to my heart 💕
						You're amazing! So kind, warm and helpful. i mean how could i ever get through my practical work
						without you helping my ass all the frikkin time! Or how you've always been there for me, no
						matter what!
						You're beautiful, so talented and one of the most fun person to be around. I could be jamming to
						hindi songs with you and at the same time have such deep conversation about life, thats the kind
						of person you are😘🤗 i really appreciate you and im so happy to have a friend like you. You're
						so loved and you deserve it all🌟
						So HAPPY FRIKKIN 21 FAV you crazy child💕🌟 We're going to party once youre back! 👅
						To more fangirling (about shows and some people xD) and making more memories as the years roll
						by😘
						Sending you LOTS of love, happiness and the tightest hug ever😻❤️
						youre 21, now dont be stupid 🙂😂🙈
						Love you alwayssss😘😋✨</div>

						I have seen you go through some really hard times, and you have always come out stronger. Your
						determination and passion really inspire me and I really admire those things about you. We have
						had some batshit crazyy share of tinder-bumble stories, and I am so glad I could share them with
						you. From discussion over topics which people find awkward to clicking super random and funny
						pictures, I am happy to have someone like you in my life to share them with. Be the badass woman
						that you are, and swalpa Mihir ko credits for carrying yo' ass around! :P But yes, a very happy
						birthday, woman! May you achieve some really amayazing things in life. 🌈🌻🥰💜😘🥺🥳🤩
						PS- Jai Maharashtra! xD

						remember all those exams we used to give at dhanukar and then just find no reason at all to go
						and sit at mcd even if we were broke as hell, just go there and have a coffee or celebrate each
						other, especially celebrate a horrible paper, lift up each other spirits, allievate anxiety.
						That equal streets like whole road where we had drawn some weird ass shit on the road w chalk,
						and laughing our asses off in class wo any alcohol legit dancing like crazy people on your
						terrace, its been a long ride. Im so happy youre a part of my whole life, all the late night
						group calls, the lets go all out and drink more, the bitching about boys and the extreme goss,
						and the absolute amazing marathi vocabulary, I really miss it all, the whole 2 years of torture,
						running to sathaye, chilling at jvc, and now its your 21st Birthday🥺🥺🥺
						Happy birthday avani🥺
						I love you so much, have the best birthday ever, we def have to meet and im looking forward to
						see u like abs crazy😭😭😭😭
						I miss you soo much🥺🥰❤️❤️❤️
						Love

						Happy birthday! Now you can be a bevdi legally ehehe.
						Your infectious smile, and approachability is what makes you really special and I hope we get to
						spend more time together. Preferably drinking and dancing. Based on whatever minimal interaction
						we have had, I can easily conclude that I like you more than I like Mihir huhuhu. But jokes
						apart, I can see how happy he is when he is with you. And that's really all I have ever wanted,
						you know?
						I am so glad you're in his life because otherwise I wouldn't have you in mine and I want you to
						know that I am gonna be there for you no matter what. So hit me up bindaas, especially if you
						wanna prank or annoy Mihir huehuehuehue.
						Happy Birthday againnn. Max hugs.❤️
